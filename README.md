# *Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning Techniques*

## Overveiw Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the power of machine learning to accurately predict diabetes. This involves several key steps, from initial data preprocessing to the application of sophisticated machine learning algorithms.

## Core Steps

- **Data Preprocessing:** Before the analysis, we ensure the data is clean and formatted correctly, which involves handling missing values and outliers.
- **Visualization:** We employ various visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights within the data, aiding in better understanding and model selection.
- **Model Building:** This step involves constructing and training machine learning models to predict diabetes.

## Algorithms Employed

We explore a range of algorithms to find the most effective model, including:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Random Forest Classifier
5. Naive Bayes
6. Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Techniques

To assess the performance of our models, we use several evaluation metrics and methods, such as:

1. Accuracy Score
2. ROC AUC Curve
3. Cross-Validation
4. Confusion Matrix

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
